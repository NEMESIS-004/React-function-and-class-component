# React Class and Functional Components

## Introduction
This repository provides an overview of React components, focusing on **Class Components** and **Functional Components**. It includes examples and explanations of both approaches to help developers understand their usage in React applications.

## Class Components
Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They use lifecycle methods and manage state via `this.state`.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyClassComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyClassComponent;
```

## Functional Components
Functional components are simpler and use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) for state and lifecycle management.

### Example
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyFunctionalComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyFunctionalComponent;
```

## Key Differences
| Feature           | Class Components | Functional Components |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Syntax           | Uses ES6 classes | Uses JavaScript functions |
| State Management | `this.state` | `useState` Hook |
| Lifecycle Methods | Uses lifecycle methods | Uses Hooks (`useEffect`) |
| Performance      | Slightly slower | More optimized |
| Complexity      | More complex | Simpler and cleaner |
| Usage           | Older React projects | Modern React development |

## Setup
To run the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-components.git
   cd react-components
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Navigate to `src/components/` to explore both class and functional components.
- Modify and experiment with the examples to understand their behavior.
